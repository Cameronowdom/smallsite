      <div class="box-t"><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Khalid Donnel Robinson was born on February 11, 1998 in Fort Stewart, Georgia and was raised by his single mother Linda Wolfe who worked in the military as a supply technician for over 10 years. Due to her job, they had to move frequently when he was young, and lived in places like Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Fort Drum in Watertown, New York, and in Heidelberg, Germany for six years.</p>
    
      <p>His parents separated when he was very young, and when he was in the second grade, living in Germany with his mother, his father was killed after being hit by a car. His mother later retired from military at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as a Sergeant First Class.</p>
          
      <p>His mother, who wanted to be an R&B singer back in the 1990s, performed with a U.S. Army band after joining military due to family issues and often practiced duets with him at home. This paroused his interest in music and prompted him to watch YouTube videos of famous singers like Fleetwood Mac, Adele, Bill Withers, Aaliyah and Father John Misty to learn their style.</p>
          
      <p>He attended his high school senior year at Americas High School in El Paso, Texas. He initially thought of becoming a music teacher, but began to write and record songs in high school and uploaded them to his Soundcloud page.</p></div>
